# 💁‍♀️ Hey there, I’m Esther Haunga! 🌸✨  

Welcome to *my* GitHub—aka the place where magic happens (or where I spend way too much time arguing with my code, but let’s keep that between us).  

### 🦄 A little about me:  
- 👀 **I’m interested in:**  
  Saving the world one line of code at a time 💻, sprinkling some ✨front-end fabulousness✨ into the web, and making tech as empowering as a killer pair of heels. Oh, and let’s not forget helping businesses run smoother than my eyeliner on a good day.  

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:**  
  How to master **front-end web design** so well that even my JavaScript bows down in respect 🧙‍♀️. Also, building cloud solutions like it’s no big deal ☁️ (but, like, it *is* a big deal, okay?).

- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on:**  
  Projects that are bold, brilliant, and maybe just a *little* chaotic. Think:  
  - Platforms that make online voting ridiculously easy.  
  - Web designs that scream *WOW*.  
  - Tech initiatives that help women take over the world (step aside, patriarchy).  

- 📫 **How to reach me:**  
  If you’ve got an offer I can’t refuse (or just a really good meme), slide into my DMs on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matron-esther/) or email me at **[YourEmail@example.com](mailto:matronesther3@gmail.com)**.  

- 😄 **Pronouns:**  
  She/Her—obviously.  

- ⚡ **Fun fact:**  
  I once tried to “quickly” fix a bug and ended up debugging for 6 hours while questioning all my life choices. Also, I’m starting a wig line because every woman deserves to feel as fabulous as their code should run. 💃💅

✨ Stick around! You might just witness some genius moments... or me yelling at my CSS for no reason. Either way, it’s a vibe. 😘
